A one day project of me when I was wanting to have an easier, lazier way to adjust Redshift
setting without the need of a text editor. Use your package manager to or software mager to
install yad for this scripts GUI dialog.

I personal like Synaptic Package Manager.

	SETUP
	Open up a terminal and run the setup.sh if you wish to install
	the script globally.
