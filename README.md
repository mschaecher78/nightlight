A one day project of me when I was wanting to have an easier, lazier way to adjust Redshift
setting without the need of a text editor. Use your package manager to or software mager to
install <span foreground='green'>yad</span> for this scripts GUI dialog.

I personal like <span foreground='green'>Synaptic Package Manager</span>.

	<span foreground='green'><b>SETUP</b>
	Open up a terminal and run the setup.sh if you wish to install
	the script globally.
